    "# Data Tidying (and a bit more) in R\n",
    "## by Diya Das and Andrey Indukaev\n",
    "\n",
    "### The goal\n",
    "Data tidying is a necessary first step for data analysis - it's the process of taking your messily formatted data (missing values, unwieldy coding/organization, etc.) and literally tidying it up so it can be easily used for downstream analyses. To quote Hadley Wickham, \"Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualise, and have a specific structure:\n",
    "each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit\n",
    "is a table.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### The datasets\n",
    "We are going to be using the data from the R package [`nycflights13`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nycflights13/nycflights13.pdf). There are five datasets corresponding to flights departing NYC in 2013. We will load directly into R from the library, but the repository also includes CSV files we created for the purposes of the Python demo and can also be used to load the data into our R session.\n",
    "\n",
    "### But the data are tidy!\n",
    "So we're going to start by making them a bit untidy. And then we're also going to teach you to do basic manipulations/operations to get statistics that can be used for downstream operations (a bit more than tidying)."
